# Contributing to sorowill-sdk

This repo participates in the **Stellar Wave Program** on [Drips](https://drips.network/wave). Contribution work is tied to issues that maintainers tag for an active Wave, and contributors earn rewards proportional to the Points assigned to the issues they resolve.

## Ground rules

- **Do not start work on any issue until you have been assigned by the maintainer.** Applying to an issue does not mean you're assigned — wait for confirmation (via the Drips Wave dashboard or a direct assignment on GitHub) before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs scoped to the issue they resolve. Unrelated changes slow down review and can cost you the Wave window.
- Be responsive during an active Wave — issues must be resolved before the Wave ends for Points to be awarded.

## Error messages and sensitive data

SoroWill is a financially sensitive application. When adding or modifying errors in `src/errors.ts` or `src/SoroWillClient.ts`, follow these rules:

- **Never embed user-supplied or contract-derived values directly in `Error.message`.** Values that must not appear in a message string include: wallet addresses, contract IDs, token addresses, raw XDR blobs, and simulation error strings from the RPC node. These can all end up in a third-party error-tracking pipeline (Sentry, Datadog, etc.) if a consumer logs `error.message` without redaction.
- **Expose sensitive context as named, typed properties instead.** The SDK's `SimulationError`, `TransactionSubmissionError`, and `InvalidCursorError` classes show the pattern: the sensitive value is stored on a typed property (`.simulationError`, `.errorXdr`, `.cursor`) so callers can decide programmatically whether to log it.
- **Method names and status code enums are acceptable in messages** because they contain no user data.
- **Debug-mode logging** (`DebugLogger`) is gated behind `debug: true` in `SoroWillClientOptions`. Even inside that gate, do not log owner addresses or other wallet keys — prefer will IDs, tx hashes, and timing information only.

## Adding a new wallet adapter

The SDK supports any Stellar wallet through the `WalletAdapter` interface defined in
`src/adapters/types.ts`. If you want to add support for a wallet that is not yet
bundled — a new browser extension, a hardware wallet, or a mobile wallet that speaks
a custom protocol — follow the steps below.

### The WalletAdapter interface

Every adapter must implement this interface:

```ts
interface WalletAdapter {
  readonly id: string;              // machine-readable identifier, e.g. 'xbull'
  readonly name: string;            // human-readable name, e.g. 'xBull Wallet'
  connect(): Promise<WalletConnection>;
  disconnect(): Promise<void>;
  isConnected(): Promise<boolean>;
  getPublicKey(): Promise<string>;
  signTransaction(transactionXdr: string, options: SignTransactionOptions): Promise<string>;
}

interface WalletConnection {
  publicKey: string;            // G… Stellar public key
  network: string;              // 'testnet' | 'mainnet' | custom chain id
  networkPassphrase: string;    // e.g. 'Test SDF Network ; September 2015'
}

interface SignTransactionOptions {
  networkPassphrase: string;
}
```

`signTransaction` receives an **unsigned** transaction XDR string and must return a
**signed** XDR string. It should never submit the transaction itself — submission is
the responsibility of the `SoroWillClient`.

There is an **optional** fourth method:

```ts
getNetwork?(): Promise<{ network: string; networkPassphrase: string }>;
```

Implementing `getNetwork` allows `SoroWillClient.assertWalletNetwork()` to verify that
the wallet is connected to the same network as the client before building a transaction.
It is strongly recommended for any wallet that can be switched between mainnet and testnet.

### Browser-extension wallets (injected provider pattern)

For browser-extension wallets that inject a provider object into the page, extend the
abstract `InjectedWalletAdapter` class in `src/adapters/injected.ts`. It handles
`connect`, `disconnect`, `isConnected`, `getPublicKey`, and `signTransaction` for you —
you only need to declare `id`, `name`, and pass the provider to `super()`:

```ts
// src/adapters/xbull.ts
import { InjectedWalletAdapter, type InjectedWalletProvider } from './injected';

export class XBullWalletAdapter extends InjectedWalletAdapter {
  readonly id = 'xbull';
  readonly name = 'xBull Wallet';

  constructor(provider: InjectedWalletProvider) {
    super(provider);
  }
}
```

The `InjectedWalletProvider` interface mirrors the minimal API that injected Stellar
wallets must implement:

```ts
interface InjectedWalletProvider {
  connect(): Promise<WalletConnection>;
  disconnect?(): Promise<void>;
  isConnected?(): Promise<boolean>;
  getPublicKey?(): Promise<string>;
  signTransaction(
    transactionXdr: string,
    options: SignTransactionOptions,
  ): Promise<string | { signedTxXdr: string }>;
}
```

**Explicit provider injection** — rather than reading from a browser global — is
intentional: it keeps the adapter testable without a real browser, and lets host
applications choose exactly which provider instance to use when multiple extensions
are present.

### Web-API / intent wallets (factory function pattern)

For wallets that expose a web-based or intent-based API (like Albedo), create a factory
function that closes over any mutable state and returns a plain `WalletAdapter` object:

```ts
// src/adapters/myWallet.ts
import type { WalletAdapter, WalletConnection } from '../wallet';

export function createMyWalletAdapter(): WalletAdapter {
  let cachedPublicKey: string | undefined;

  return {
    id: 'my-wallet',
    name: 'My Wallet',

    async isConnected() {
      return cachedPublicKey !== undefined;
    },

    async connect(): Promise<WalletConnection> {
      // Call your wallet's connect / publicKey API here
      cachedPublicKey = await myWalletSdk.getPublicKey();
      return {
        publicKey: cachedPublicKey,
        network: 'mainnet',
        networkPassphrase: 'Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015',
      };
    },

    async disconnect() {
      cachedPublicKey = undefined;
    },

    async getPublicKey() {
      if (cachedPublicKey) return cachedPublicKey;
      const conn = await this.connect();
      return conn.publicKey;
    },

    async signTransaction(transactionXdr, opts) {
      // Forward to the wallet's signing API and return signed XDR
      const { signedXdr } = await myWalletSdk.signXdr(transactionXdr, opts.networkPassphrase);
      return signedXdr;
    },
  };
}
```

### WalletConnect-based wallets

For wallets that speak WalletConnect, use the bundled `WalletConnectAdapter` class from
`src/walletConnect.ts` directly — pass a WalletConnect client and your session
configuration. Only create a separate adapter file if you need to bake in
wallet-specific defaults (chain IDs, signing methods, session extraction logic):

```ts
import { WalletConnectAdapter } from '@sorowill/sdk';

const adapter = new WalletConnectAdapter(walletConnectClient, {
  requiredNamespaces: {
    stellar: {
      methods: ['stellar_signXdr'],
      chains: ['stellar:testnet'],
      events: [],
    },
  },
  network: 'testnet',
  networkPassphrase: 'Test SDF Network ; September 2015',
  connectionTimeoutMs: 30_000,
  onPairingUri: (uri) => showQrCode(uri),
});
```

### Wiring the adapter into the SDK

1. **Create the adapter file** in `src/adapters/`, following one of the patterns above.
2. **Re-export it** from `src/adapters/index.ts`:
   ```ts
   export { XBullWalletAdapter } from './xbull';
   ```
3. **Export it from the package root** (`src/index.ts`) with a matching type export if
   the adapter exposes a custom options interface:
   ```ts
   export { XBullWalletAdapter } from './adapters';
   ```
4. **Add a row to the _Wallet adapters_ table** in `README.md` under the appropriate
   section. The table is the single source of truth for what the package exposes — a
   missing row will be flagged during code review.

### Testing strategy for adapters

Put adapter unit tests in `test/adapters.test.ts` (or a dedicated file for complex
adapters).  The key principle is **never depend on a real browser or a live wallet
process** in unit tests — always inject a mock provider.

#### Injected-provider adapters

Construct a plain mock object that satisfies `InjectedWalletProvider`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { XBullWalletAdapter } from '../src/adapters/xbull';

describe('XBullWalletAdapter', () => {
  function makeProvider(publicKey = 'GABC123') {
    return {
      connect: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
        publicKey,
        network: 'testnet',
        networkPassphrase: 'Test SDF Network ; September 2015',
      }),
      disconnect: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
      isConnected: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(false),
      signTransaction: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue('SIGNED_XDR'),
    };
  }

  it('returns the public key after connect()', async () => {
    const adapter = new XBullWalletAdapter(makeProvider('GABC123'));
    await adapter.connect();
    expect(await adapter.getPublicKey()).toBe('GABC123');
  });

  it('returns signed XDR from signTransaction()', async () => {
    const provider = makeProvider();
    const adapter = new XBullWalletAdapter(provider);
    await adapter.connect();
    const signed = await adapter.signTransaction('UNSIGNED_XDR', {
      networkPassphrase: 'Test SDF Network ; September 2015',
    });
    expect(signed).toBe('SIGNED_XDR');
  });

  it('isConnected returns false after disconnect()', async () => {
    const adapter = new XBullWalletAdapter(makeProvider());
    await adapter.connect();
    await adapter.disconnect();
    expect(await adapter.isConnected()).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

#### Factory-function adapters

Swap the underlying SDK module with a `vi.mock()` call and assert that the adapter
calls the correct SDK methods with the correct arguments:

```ts
vi.mock('my-wallet-sdk', () => ({
  default: {
    getPublicKey: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue('GABC123'),
    signXdr: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ signedXdr: 'SIGNED_XDR' }),
  },
}));
```

#### What to test

For every new adapter, cover at minimum:

| Scenario | What to assert |
|---|---|
| `connect()` | Returns a `WalletConnection` with the correct `publicKey` and `networkPassphrase` |
| `getPublicKey()` | Returns the same key without re-connecting |
| `signTransaction()` | Returns a signed XDR string |
| `isConnected()` before connect | Returns `false` |
| `isConnected()` after connect | Returns `true` |
| `disconnect()` | Clears state; `isConnected()` returns `false` afterwards |
| `signTransaction()` before connect | Throws with a descriptive message |
| Network mismatch (if `getNetwork()` is implemented) | Correctly reports the wallet's active network |

## Pull requests

- Your PR description must reference the issue it resolves (e.g. `Closes #12`).
- Make sure `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` all pass cleanly before requesting review.
- Add or update unit tests in `test/` for any behavior change to `src/utils.ts` or type validation logic.
- Keep the public API in `src/index.ts` in sync with any new exports.
- **When adding a new top-level export**, also add a row to the _Full public API_ table in `README.md` (under the appropriate section). The table is the single source of truth for what the package exposes — keeping it current helps consumers discover the API without reading the source. A missing row will be flagged during code review.
- **If your PR changes public behavior** (new features, breaking changes, deprecations, or behavioral fixes), add a bullet entry under the `[Unreleased]` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md). The release workflow (`publish.yml`) triggers from published GitHub Releases, and the changelog is the authoritative record of what shipped in each version.

## Publishing

Publishing is normally handled by the GitHub release workflow (`publish.yml`), which builds explicitly before packing. If you ever publish manually from a local checkout, the `prepublishOnly` hook in `package.json` runs `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` automatically before the package is packed, so a stale or missing `dist/` cannot be published. You do not need to run the build by hand first — but if the hook fails, fix the reported build or type errors and retry rather than bypassing it with `--ignore-scripts`.

## API reference

The full public API reference is generated from JSDoc comments via [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).

### Generating locally

```bash
npm run docs:api
```

Output lands in `docs/api/` (gitignored). Open `docs/api/index.html` in a browser to browse the
generated HTML reference. Alternatively, run the command and point a local HTTP server at the
directory:

```bash
npx serve docs/api
```

### Keeping docs in sync

- Every public symbol exported from `src/index.ts` should have a JSDoc comment (`/** ... */`).
- When adding or renaming exports, re-run `npm run docs:api` locally and verify the symbol appears
  in the generated output before opening your PR.
- TypeDoc reads from `typedoc.json` at the repo root — adjust category or navigation settings
  there, not via CLI flags.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages

The reference can be published automatically via GitHub Actions. Add a workflow job such as:

```yaml
- name: Generate API docs
  run: npm run docs:api

- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: docs/api
```

Trigger this job on every push to `main` (or as a separate manual/release workflow). GitHub Pages
must be enabled in the repository settings with the source set to the `gh-pages` branch. Once
deployed, the reference is reachable at
`https://sorowill.github.io/sorowill-sdk/`.

## Documenting type changes (issue #501)

When the SoroWill contract is upgraded and a public interface or enum in
`src/types.ts` must change, follow these steps so consumers can upgrade safely:

### 1. Add a `@since` tag to every new or changed field

```ts
export interface Will {
  /**
   * New field added in 0.2.0.
   * @since 0.2.0
   */
  newField: string;
}
```

### 2. Add a Change history table to the interface/enum JSDoc

```ts
/**
 * The full on-chain state of a will.
 *
 * ## Change history
 * | SDK version | Change |
 * |-------------|--------|
 * | 0.1.0       | Interface introduced. |
 * | 0.2.0       | `newField` added. **Breaking**: existing serialised `Will` objects will not have this field; consumers must handle `undefined` until data is refreshed from the RPC. |
 */
export interface Will { ... }
```

### 3. Add a CHANGELOG entry

Under `[Unreleased] → ### Changed` (for breaking changes) or `### Added`
(for purely additive changes):

```md
- `Will` interface: `newField` added (contract upgrade v2). **Breaking** for
  consumers that store serialised `Will` objects — see MIGRATION.md (closes #NNN).
```

### 4. Add a migration section to MIGRATION.md

For every breaking change, add a versioned section to `MIGRATION.md` that
explains:
- What changed and why.
- A before/after table.
- Concrete code snippets showing how to update call sites and any persisted data.

### 5. Verify

Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` to make sure no existing code silently
breaks. If `WillStatus` gains a new variant, TypeScript's exhaustiveness
checking will surface any unhandled `switch` branches in the codebase.

## ScVal / XDR snapshot tests

Every state-changing method encodes its arguments into Soroban `ScVal`s via
`spec.funcArgsToScVals(method, args)` before building a transaction. A future
upgrade to `@stellar/stellar-sdk` could silently change that encoding — for
example altering how `u64` or `Address` values are serialised — producing
transactions that the contract rejects, with nothing in CI catching the
regression.

Snapshot tests lock in the exact `ScVal` / XDR output for each method's
typical arguments so any encoding change is caught immediately.

### Running the snapshot tests

```bash
npm test
```

Vitest runs all tests including the snapshot suite. Snapshot files live next to
the test files under `test/__snapshots__/`.

### Reviewing a snapshot diff

When a snapshot assertion fails you will see a diff like:

```
- Snapshot  "create_will args ScVal snapshot 1"
+ Received

  - scvMap: [ { key: scvSymbol("owner"), val: scvAddress(...) }, ... ]
  + scvMap: [ { key: scvSymbol("owner"), val: scvAddress(...) }, ... ]
```

Before updating, answer these questions:

1. **What changed?** Identify the `@stellar/stellar-sdk` commit or release note
   that explains the encoding difference.
2. **Is the new encoding correct on-chain?** Simulate the new XDR against the
   deployed testnet contract (`npm run test -- --reporter=verbose`) and confirm
   it succeeds.
3. **Is the change intentional?** If a dependency upgrade deliberately changes
   encoding for correctness, the snapshot should be updated. If you cannot
   explain why the encoding changed, treat it as a potential regression and do
   not update.

### Intentionally updating snapshots

Once you have verified the new encoding is correct, update the snapshot file:

```bash
npx vitest run --update-snapshots
```

Commit **both** the source change that caused the encoding to shift (e.g. the
`package.json` version bump) **and** the updated snapshot file in the same PR,
with a description explaining why the XDR shape changed. Reviewers should be
able to cross-reference the diff against the upstream SDK changelog.

### Adding a snapshot for a new method

When you add a new state-changing method, add a corresponding snapshot
assertion in `test/sorowill-client-sdk.test.ts` (or a dedicated snapshot test
file). Use `toMatchSnapshot()` on the serialised ScVal array:

```ts
it('encodes create_will args to the expected ScVal shape', () => {
  const scVals = spec.funcArgsToScVals('create_will', {
    owner: 'GABC...',
    token: 'CABC...',
    amount: 1_000_000n,
    beneficiaries: [{ address: 'GBEN', percentage: 100 }],
    checkin_period_days: 90n,
    grace_period_days: 7n,
    guardians: [],
  });
  expect(scVals.map((v) => v.toXDR('base64'))).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

Run `npx vitest run --update-snapshots` once to write the initial snapshot,
then commit it. All subsequent runs will assert against that baseline.

## Soroban sandbox integration tests

`test/soroban-sandbox-integration.test.ts` exercises the full will lifecycle
against a real deployed Soroban contract rather than a mock. It is skipped
automatically — not run in CI — unless all three of its required environment
variables are set:

```bash
export SOROBAN_SANDBOX_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8000  # optional, defaults to this
export SOROBAN_CONTRACT_ID=C...       # a deployed SoroW

/* … truncated 3048 chars — edit only what you need near the top … */
